						<p>Salon managers, salon suite owners, and anyone that has unused space for rent or lease would benefit from using the features for a salon owner account.  The features are very easy to use.
							<br><br>
							Once you register and post your available rentals, then salon professionals will be able to locate your posting and rent it.
							<br><br>
							Owners are required to have a PayPal account for deposits.  When your rental is booked,

							<br><br>
							then the funds will be deposited into your PayPal account the day after the rental starting date and any reoccurring dates.
							<br><br>
							 If you need a professional to assist you in your salon space, then you can use a notification feature to send a help request to area professionals.
							<br><br>
							The interested professionals will reply to the notification, you will select one, and the professional will schedule to provide services in your salon.

									<p>
										Professionals can use search features to locate rental space in the desired areas for a selected time period.  Then, they can select a start and end period for reoccurring rentals and book it for the posted price.  No additional fee will be charged for using our site to create a profile, locate space, and book it.  The rental locations are posted on the professional’s appointment calendar for multiple rental locations.
										<br><br>
										Professionals will be able to post their provided service and clients will be able to book the services to an appointment calendar.  In addition, the professional can turn on a “waiting list” feature that will allow clients to sign in a time slot for the day.
										<br>
										An “online” feature will allow the professional to receive notifications from salon owners to assist in salons and notifications from clients for special price services.
										<br><br>
										Interested professionals can reply to the notification and if selected then the service date and time will be booked into the professional’s appointment calendar.
										Salons in The Loop will retain 10% of the paid amount for connecting you to the job posted.
										<br><br>
										You will receive the remaining 90% the day after the service date.  Professionals are required to have a PayPal account for deposits.

						<h3>How it Works <span>Salon Clients</span></h3>
					</div>
					<div class="how1 how2">
						<p>Clients can locate nearby hair stylists, barbers, estheticians, braiders, weavers, manicurist, shampoo techs, lashes and brow specialist, colorist, cosmetology students, mobile stylist, traveling stylist, makeup artist, and any professional listed.
<br><br>
Clients can schedule appointments or sign in on a professional’s waiting list page to be seen the same day.  The waiting list is a feature designed to allow a client to see if a salon or barber shop is busy in real time.
<br><br>
It works well for those that do not like to make appointments, but would like to know if the professional can fit them in.  This free feature does not require registration.
<br><br>
When the professional turns the feature “On”, then the clients can sign in and send a note.
<br>
A “Name My Own Price” feature will allow clients to upload pictures and send a description of what they need to selected professional types in a desired area and pay the price that they would like to pay.
<br><br>
The request will be sent to professionals and the client will be able to select from responders and book an appointment. Salonsintheloop.com collects the amount so that you pay the agreed amount.
<br><br>
There is no fee for clients to use the Site.  Cancellations may be done 48 hours or more prior to the appointment start time and a full refund will be issued.
<br><br>
Refunds will be issued for professional no shows and other service breaches by the professional.
